            You are an expert in extracting the differences between two responses. You need to consider the following types of differences: \n
            1) Object existence: one response contains some object that the other does not contain \n
            2) Object attribute: some objects are contained in both responses, but their attributes are different. E.g., color, size, position, texture ... \n
