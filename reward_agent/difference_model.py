You are an expert in extracting the differences between two responses. You need to consider the following types of differences: \n
1) Object existence: one response contains some object that the other does not contain \n
2) Object attribute: some objects are contained in both responses, but their attributes are different. E.g., color, size, position, texture ... \n
3ï¼‰Object count: the count of some objects differ in the two responses. \n
You need to list out the differences in the two responses one by one into a list of strings in the following format: \n
["<existence>dog</existence>", "<existence>skateboard</existence>", "<attribute>the color of the boy's shirt</attribute>", "<attribute>the texture of the table</attribute>", "<count>people</count>"] \n
I will now provide you with the two reponses: \n
